Here you will find movement animations for you to see some of my experience.

Idle animations don't make much sense to show them because you can't see details, you can see very little, and in the game (I make animations with Blender) they look much better.

In these animations, I complement certain rules of animation, there are subtle details that show a lot of difference between them, you can see it in the 3, they are simple, I hope you like them and convince you :D.
